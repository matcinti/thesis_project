# AI for Pancreatic Cancer Survival (Thesis Project)

## Abstract:
Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal form of cancer with a poor prognosis. Accurate prediction of patient survival can assist in treatment planning and personalized care. In this study, we explore the predictive utility of deep learning radiomic (DLR) features extracted from CT scans for PDAC patient survival prediction. We compare the performance of DLR features with hand-crafted radiomic (HCR) features and investigate their integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR) features. Furthermore, we examine the differences between features extracted from pre-neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) scans and those from post-NAT scans, which may contain additional valuable information. The dataset consists of CT scans from approximately 100 patients with PDAC, collected between 2013-2020 at the Amsterdam UMC. Our methodology involves data collection, feature extraction, feature preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. We compared three different survival models: Cox Proportional Hazard (COX PH), Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Gradient Boosting. In terms of predictive accuracy, the best model solely utilizing radiomic features registers a c-index of 0.591 for DLR features (COX PH) and 0.578 for HCR features (COX PH). Upon integration with EHR, the performance of the best model for DLR enhances to 0.699 (RSF), while for HCR, it rises to 0.675 (Gradient Boosting). These findings apply only to pre-NAT scans as all radiomic features derived from post-NAT scans proved to be non-informative. Our findings indicate that DLR features, obtained from pre-NAT CT scans through transfer learning using a pretrained VGG19 model, exhibit significant predictive power and perform comparably and even slightly better than HCR features. 

## About the repository:
The feature_extraction folder contains two python scripts to extract hand-crafted radiomic features and deep learning radiomic features. In the training folder there are five different notebooks for the five set of features: HCR, DLR, HCR + EHR, DLR + EHR, EHR.
